The aim of this study is to analyze how the rising awareness of Korean Wave (K-Culture) elements—such as K-pop, K-dramas, and K-movies—in English-speaking countries has influenced the mention volume and sentiment scores related to Hansik (Korean cuisine) in the media. Based on this analysis, the study seeks to provide insights into whether and how K-Culture can be strategically leveraged to effectively market Hansik in these regions.

This research is an extended and refined version of my final substitute project for the 'Statistics for English Data Analysis' course at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (Spring 2025), developed further based on the professor’s feedback.

The research covers the period from January 1, 2015 to July 25, 2025, during which data from Google Trends, GDELT, and The Guardian were scraped and used for analysis.
